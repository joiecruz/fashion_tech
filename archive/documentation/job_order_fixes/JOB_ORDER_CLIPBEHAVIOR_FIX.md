# Job Order Statistics ClipBehavior Assertion Fix

## Problem
Flutter assertion error: `'decoration != null || clipBehavior == Clip.none'` was occurring in the job order statistics component.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by trying to use `clipBehavior: Clip.hardEdge` on an `AnimatedContainer` that didn't have a `decoration` property. Flutter requires that if you want to use `clipBehavior` on a Container, it must have a decoration.

## Flutter Constraint
```dart
// ❌ This causes assertion error
AnimatedContainer(
  clipBehavior: Clip.hardEdge, // Error: no decoration provided
  constraints: BoxConstraints(...),
  child: ...,
)

// ✅ This would work but adds unnecessary decoration
AnimatedContainer(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(), // Required for clipBehavior
  clipBehavior: Clip.hardEdge,
  constraints: BoxConstraints(...),
  child: ...,
)
```

## Solution Applied
Instead of adding a decoration to the `AnimatedContainer`, we wrapped it in a `ClipRect` widget, which provides the same clipping functionality without requiring a decoration:

```dart
// ✅ Clean solution using ClipRect
ClipRect(
  child: AnimatedContainer(
    duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
    curve: Curves.easeInOut,
    constraints: BoxConstraints(
      maxHeight: isExpanded ? 70 : 0,
    ),
    child: AnimatedOpacity(...),
  ),
)
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **No Assertion Error**: Eliminates the Flutter framework assertion
- ✅ **Clean Clipping**: `ClipRect` provides proper overflow clipping
- ✅ **No Unnecessary Decoration**: Avoids adding empty decoration just for clipping
- ✅ **Smooth Animation**: Maintains the 300ms synchronized animation timing
- ✅ **Better Performance**: `ClipRect` is more efficient than Container with decoration for clipping

## Files Modified
- **File**: `lib/frontend/job_orders/components/job_order_stats.dart`
- **Change**: Removed `clipBehavior: Clip.hardEdge` from `AnimatedContainer`
- **Added**: `ClipRect` wrapper around `AnimatedContainer`

## Technical Note
This is a common Flutter pattern where clipping is needed for animation containers:
1. Use `ClipRect` for rectangular clipping without decoration
2. Use `Container` with `clipBehavior` only when you already have a decoration
3. Use `ClipRRect` for rounded rectangle clipping

## Status
**COMPLETED** - The assertion error has been resolved and the animation clipping works correctly.
