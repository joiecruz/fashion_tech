# Job Order Statistics Collapse Fix

## Problem
When the statistics section in the job order list page was collapsed, the entire content was collapsing with it, causing layout issues where the job order cards and other content became invisible or improperly positioned.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `JobOrderStats` component (`lib/frontend/job_orders/components/job_order_stats.dart`). The component was using conditional rendering:

```dart
child: isExpanded ? Container(...) : const SizedBox.shrink(),
```

This conditional rendering within an `AnimatedContainer` with `maxHeight` constraints was causing the entire layout to become unstable when the animation occurred.

## Solution
Removed the conditional rendering and always render the `Container` with content, but rely on:
1. `AnimatedOpacity` (opacity: 0.0 when collapsed)
2. `AnimatedContainer` with `maxHeight: 0` when collapsed

This ensures the layout remains stable during the collapse/expand animation.

## Files Modified

### 1. JobOrderStats Component
- **File**: `lib/frontend/job_orders/components/job_order_stats.dart`
- **Change**: Removed conditional rendering `isExpanded ? Container(...) : const SizedBox.shrink()`
- **Fix**: Always render the Container with stats content, but use opacity and maxHeight for animation

## Code Changes

### Before:
```dart
child: isExpanded ? Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(20, 4, 20, 4),
  child: SingleChildScrollView(
    scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
    child: Row(
      children: [
        // ... stat cards
      ],
    ),
  ),
) : const SizedBox.shrink(),
```

### After:
```dart
child: Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(20, 4, 20, 4),
  child: SingleChildScrollView(
    scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
    child: Row(
      children: [
        // ... stat cards
      ],
    ),
  ),
),
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Fixed layout collapse issue when statistics are collapsed
- ✅ Maintained smooth animation between expanded/collapsed states
- ✅ Preserved existing functionality and visual design
- ✅ Job order cards and other content remain visible when stats are collapsed
- ✅ Consistent behavior with other dashboard pages

## Testing
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Statistics section expands/collapses smoothly
- ✅ Job order content remains visible in both states
- ✅ Animation performance maintained
- ✅ Layout stability improved

## Status
**COMPLETED** - The job order statistics collapse issue has been resolved. The page now behaves correctly when the statistics section is collapsed, with all content remaining visible and properly positioned.
