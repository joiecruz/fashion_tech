# Size Text Visibility Fix

## Problem
After the initial aesthetic improvements, the size text in the dropdown became too subtle and difficult to read. The "XXXL" and other size indicators were barely visible due to low contrast.

## Root Cause
1. **Text colors too light**: The previous color scheme used muted text colors that didn't provide enough contrast
2. **Font weight too light**: The font weight was not bold enough for small dropdown displays
3. **Font size too small**: In compact mode, the text was too small to be easily readable

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Text Colors for Better Contrast
Updated all size text colors to use darker, more readable shades:

```dart
static const Map<String, Color> sizeTextColors = {
  'XS': Color(0xFF1F2937),    // Dark gray (was lighter gray)
  'S': Color(0xFF047857),     // Dark green (was medium green)
  'M': Color(0xFFB45309),     // Dark amber (was lighter amber)
  'L': Color(0xFF6B21A8),     // Dark purple (was medium purple)
  'XL': Color(0xFF3730A3),    // Dark indigo (was medium indigo)
  'XXL': Color(0xFF374151),   // Dark gray (was light gray)
  'XXXL': Color(0xFF0C4A6E),  // Dark sky (was light sky)
  'Free Size': Color(0xFF86198F), // Dark fuchsia (was medium fuchsia)
};
```

### 2. Improved Background Colors
Enhanced background colors for better contrast while maintaining aesthetics:

```dart
static const Map<String, Color> sizeColors = {
  'XS': Color(0xFFF8FAFC),    // Light slate
  'S': Color(0xFFECFDF5),     // Light emerald
  'M': Color(0xFFFFFBEB),     // Light amber
  'L': Color(0xFFF3E8FF),     // Light violet
  'XL': Color(0xFFEEF2FF),    // Light indigo
  'XXL': Color(0xFFF1F5F9),   // Light slate
  'XXXL': Color(0xFFF0F9FF),  // Light sky
  'Free Size': Color(0xFFFDF4FF), // Light fuchsia
};
```

### 3. Enhanced Typography
Improved font properties for better readability:

#### Regular Size Indicators:
- **Font size**: Increased from `12px` to `13px` (compact) and `14px` to `15px` (regular)
- **Font weight**: Increased from `FontWeight.w600` to `FontWeight.w700`
- **Letter spacing**: Increased from `0.3` to `0.4` (compact) and `0.5` to `0.6` (regular)

#### Compact Size Indicators:
- **Font size**: Increased from `11px` to `12px`
- **Font weight**: Increased from `FontWeight.w600` to `FontWeight.w700`
- **Letter spacing**: Increased from `0.2` to `0.3`

### 4. Visual Enhancements
- **High contrast**: Dark text on light backgrounds ensures maximum readability
- **Bold typography**: Heavy font weight makes text stand out in dropdown contexts
- **Optimal sizing**: Larger text prevents squinting and improves user experience
- **Maintained aesthetics**: Colors remain modern and visually appealing while being functional

## Results
1. **✅ High Visibility**: Size text is now clearly visible and easy to read
2. **✅ Professional Look**: Maintains modern, clean aesthetic
3. **✅ Better UX**: Users can easily identify and select sizes
4. **✅ Accessibility**: Improved contrast ratios for better accessibility
5. **✅ Consistent Design**: Works well across all UI contexts

## Testing
- Size dropdowns now display text with high contrast and readability
- All size options ("XS", "S", "M", "L", "XL", "XXL", "XXXL", "Free Size") are clearly visible
- Both compact and regular size indicators maintain excellent visibility
- Colors provide good contrast ratios for accessibility compliance

## Files Modified
- `lib/utils/size_utils.dart` - Enhanced text colors, background colors, and typography

The size text visibility issue has been completely resolved while maintaining the modern, aesthetic design.
