# Variant Card & Breakdown Summary Overflow Fixes

## Overview
Fixed overflow issues in the variant card components and quantity allocation charts for small device widths, ensuring all content remains visible and properly formatted on mobile and narrow screens.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Quantity Allocation Progress Bar (Variant Cards)
**Problem**: Long status text and quantity ratios were overflowing on small screens
**Solution**: 
- Reduced font size from 11px to 10px for quantity ratio text
- Reduced font size from 11px to 10px for status text
- Added `maxLines: 2` and `TextOverflow.ellipsis` for status text
- Made quantity container more compact with smaller padding

### 2. Fabric Availability Tracker (Variant Cards)
**Problem**: "Fabric Availability" text and yardage ratios were overflowing horizontally
**Solution**:
- Wrapped "Fabric Availability" text in `Expanded` widget
- Added `TextOverflow.ellipsis` to prevent text overflow
- Reduced font size from 11px to 10px for yardage ratio
- Removed "yds" suffix and reduced padding to save space
- Added `maxLines: 2` for status messages
- Reduced font size from 11px to 10px for availability status

### 3. Fabric Colors Section (Variant Cards)
**Problem**: Fabric name labels were overflowing when fabric names were long
**Solution**:
- Wrapped fabric colors in `SingleChildScrollView` with horizontal scrolling
- Reduced color circle size from 24px to 20px
- Reduced font size from 10px to 9px for fabric names
- Added fixed width container (60px) for fabric names
- Added `textAlign: TextAlign.center` for better alignment
- Reduced border width from 2px to 1.5px

### 4. Quantity Allocation Chart (Breakdown Summary)
**Problem**: Variant labels and percentage text were overflowing on small screens
**Solution**:
- Wrapped variant name text in `Expanded` widget
- Added `TextOverflow.ellipsis` for variant labels
- Reduced font size from 12px to 11px for variant text
- Changed percentage format from one decimal to no decimal places
- Removed `const Spacer()` and used `Expanded` + `SizedBox(width: 4)`

### 5. Chart Header (Breakdown Summary)
**Problem**: Chart title and ratio text were overflowing horizontally
**Solution**:
- Wrapped chart title in `Expanded` widget
- Added `TextOverflow.ellipsis` for title text
- Reduced font size from default to 14px for title
- Reduced font size from 12px to 11px for ratio text
- Reduced padding and spacing between elements
- Removed space character from ratio display (`/` instead of ` / `)

### 6. Summary Cards (Breakdown Summary)
**Problem**: Summary cards were taking too much space and causing horizontal overflow
**Solution**:
- Added fixed width (120px) to prevent overflow
- Reduced padding from 16px to 12px
- Reduced icon size from 20px to 18px
- Reduced value font size from 18px to 16px
- Reduced title font size from 12px to 11px
- Added `TextOverflow.ellipsis` with `maxLines` for all text
- Reduced spacing between elements

## Technical Changes

### Font Size Reductions
- Quantity allocation status: 11px → 10px
- Quantity ratio text: 11px → 10px  
- Fabric availability status: 11px → 10px
- Fabric availability ratio: 11px → 10px
- Fabric name labels: 10px → 9px
