# UI Cleanup Summary - Add Fabric Modal

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Optional Labels
- **Min Order Qty**: Changed from "Min Order Qty (Optional)" to "Min Order Qty"
- All other fields already had their "(Optional)" labels removed in previous updates

### 2. Removed Prefix Icons
Removed prefix icons from all form fields for a cleaner, more aesthetic UI:
- **Expense per yard**: Removed `Icons.attach_money` prefix icon
- **Quality Grade**: Removed `Icons.star_rate` prefix icon  
- **Min Order Qty**: Removed `Icons.inventory_2` prefix icon
- **Supplier**: Removed `Icons.business` prefix icon
- **Notes & Reasons**: Removed `Icons.note_alt_outlined` prefix icon

### 3. Updated Hint Text
- **Min Order**: Changed from "Enter minimum order (optional - defaults to 0)" to "Enter minimum order or leave empty for 0"
- **Notes**: Changed from "Any additional notes about this fabric (optional)..." to "Any additional notes about this fabric..."
