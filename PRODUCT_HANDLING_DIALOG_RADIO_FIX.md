# Product Handling Dialog - Redundant Radio Buttons Fix

## Issue Description
The complete job order modal (ProductHandlingDialog) had two identical sets of radio buttons for selecting the product handling action, making the interface redundant and confusing.

## Problem Identified
1. **First radio button set** (lines 228-252): Main selection for product handling action
2. **Second radio button set** (lines 405-429): Duplicate set right before the action buttons

## Solution Applied
- **Removed** the redundant second set of radio buttons at the bottom of the dialog
- **Kept** the original radio button set in the main content area
- **Maintained** all functionality while cleaning up the UI

## Changes Made

### File Modified:
- `lib/frontend/job_orders/components/product_handling_dialog.dart`

### Specific Changes:
- **Removed lines 401-429**: The redundant "Choose product handling action" section with duplicate radio buttons
- **Kept the original radio buttons** in their proper location within the dialog content

## Result
- **Cleaner UI**: No more duplicate radio button options
- **Better UX**: Less confusion for users
- **Maintained Functionality**: All product handling options still available
- **No Breaking Changes**: Dialog still works exactly the same

## Radio Button Options (Single Set):
1. **Add to Linked Product** (if job order has linked product)
2. **Create New Product** 
3. **Select Existing Product**

## Status: âœ… FIXED

The redundant radio buttons have been successfully removed. The complete job order modal now has a cleaner interface with only one set of radio buttons for product handling selection.
