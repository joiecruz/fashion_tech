# Product Category Removal from Job Order Completion

## Issue Description
The product handling dialog (when completing job orders) was asking users to select a product category again, even though the category was already specified during the "Add Job Order" process. This created redundancy and extra steps for users.

## Problem Identified
In the **ProductHandlingDialog**, when users chose "Create New Product", they were prompted to:
1. Select a product category from a dropdown
2. This was redundant since product category is already set when creating the job order

## Solution Applied
- **Removed** the product category dropdown from the product handling dialog
- **Removed** unused variables:
  - `_selectedCategory` (String)
  - `_categories` (List<String>)
- **Updated** ProductHandlingResult to pass `categoryID: null`
- **Logic Updated**: The job order actions will now use the original product's category from the job order data

## Changes Made

### File Modified:
- `lib/frontend/job_orders/components/product_handling_dialog.dart`

### Specific Changes:
1. **Removed Category Selection UI**:
   ```dart
   // REMOVED:
   const Text('Product Category:', style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.w600, fontSize: 14)),
   DropdownButtonFormField<String>(...)
   ```

2. **Removed Unused Variables**:
   ```dart
   // REMOVED:
   String _selectedCategory = 'top';
   final List<String> _categories = [...];
   ```

3. **Updated Result Creation**:
   ```dart
   // BEFORE:
   categoryID: _selectedCategory,
   
   // AFTER:
   categoryID: null, // Use original product category from job order
   ```

## Backend Logic
The `job_order_actions.dart` already has fallback logic to use the original product's category:
```dart
'categoryID': productResult.categoryID ?? jobOrderData['category'] ?? originalProductInfo['category'] ?? 'custom'
```

Since `productResult.categoryID` is now `null`, it will use:
1. `jobOrderData['category']` - Category from the job order
2. `originalProductInfo['category']` - Original product's category
3. `'custom'` - Fallback if neither is available

## User Experience Improvements
- **Fewer Steps**: Users no longer need to re-select product category
- **Less Confusion**: No duplicate category selection
- **Consistency**: Uses the same category that was set during job order creation
- **Streamlined Flow**: Faster job order completion process

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Complete a job order and choose "Create New Product"
- [ ] Verify no category dropdown appears
- [ ] Verify created product uses correct category from original job order
- [ ] Test with different job order categories
- [ ] Ensure no compilation errors

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

The redundant product category selection has been successfully removed from the job order completion dialog. The system now automatically uses the category from the original job order/product data.
