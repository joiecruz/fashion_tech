# Product Inventory Display Fix - Show All Products

## Issue Description
The product inventory page was only showing 4 products when there were actually 7 products in the database. Some products were being automatically filtered out and hidden from view.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `_filterProducts()` method in `product_inventory_page.dart`. The filtering logic was automatically excluding products with zero stock:

```dart
// OLD CODE - Problematic filtering
final int stock = product['stock'] ?? 0;
bool hasStock = stock > 0;
return matchesSearch && matchesCategory && matchesUpcycled && matchesLowStock && hasStock;
```

This meant that:
- Products with all variants having 0 stock were completely hidden
- Users couldn't see products that were out of stock but still valid
- No way to manage, edit, or restock these products

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Automatic Stock Filtering
**File**: `lib/frontend/products/product_inventory_page.dart`

- **Removed** the automatic filtering of products with zero stock
- **Updated** filtering logic to show all products by default
- **Added** optional "Hide Out of Stock" filter for users who want to hide them

```dart
// NEW CODE - Fixed filtering
return matchesSearch && matchesCategory && matchesUpcycled && matchesLowStock && hasStock;
// where hasStock = !_hideOutOfStock || (product['stock'] ?? 0) > 0;
```

### 2. Added Optional Out-of-Stock Filter
- **Added** `_hideOutOfStock` boolean state variable
- **Added** "Hide Out of Stock" filter chip in the UI
- **Updated** filter reset logic to include the new filter

### 3. Enhanced Visual Indicators
- **Added** "Out of Stock" status label for products with zero stock
- **Added** out-of-stock count to statistics display
- **Updated** statistics layout to show 4 cards in a 2x2 grid

### 4. Improved Statistics Display
- **Added** `_outOfStockCount` getter to track out-of-stock products
- **Updated** statistics summary to show out-of-stock count
- **Redesigned** stats cards layout for better information display
