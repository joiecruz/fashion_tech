# Overflow Fix Summary

## Issue
The text labels "Expense per yard (₱)" and "Quality Grade" were causing overflow in the row layouts of both add and edit fabric modals due to their length.

## Solution
Wrapped the text labels with `Flexible` widgets to allow them to adapt to available space and prevent overflow.

## Changes Made

### Add Fabric Modal (add_fabric_modal.dart)
1. **Expense per yard field**: Wrapped the label text with `Flexible` widget
2. **Quality Grade field**: Wrapped the label text with `Flexible` widget

### Edit Fabric Modal (edit_fabric_modal.dart)
1. **Expense per yard field**: Wrapped the label text with `Flexible` widget
2. **Quality Grade field**: 
   - Wrapped the label text with `Flexible` widget
   - Added missing red asterisk (*) to indicate it's a required field

## Code Changes

### Before
```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Text(
      'Expense per yard (₱)',
      style: TextStyle(...),
    ),
    Text(' *', style: TextStyle(...)),
  ],
),
```

### After
```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Flexible(
      child: Text(
        'Expense per yard (₱)',
        style: TextStyle(...),
      ),
    ),
    Text(' *', style: TextStyle(...)),
  ],
),
```

## Benefits
- Prevents text overflow on smaller screens
- Maintains responsive design
- Ensures consistent UI across different screen sizes
- Added missing required field indicator for Quality Grade in edit modal
