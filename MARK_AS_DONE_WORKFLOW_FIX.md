# MARK AS DONE WORKFLOW FIX

## Issue
Previously, when "Mark as Done" was pressed on a job order, the system would:
1. ✅ Immediately change the job order status to "Done" in the database
2. ✅ Show the product handling dialog
3. ✅ Wait for user to select an action (create new product, add to existing, etc.)
4. ✅ Process the selected action

**Problem:** If the user cancelled the product handling dialog or if the product action failed, the job order would still be marked as "Done" even though the process wasn't completed.

## Solution
Changed the workflow to only mark the job order as "Done" AFTER successful completion of all actions:

### New Workflow:
1. ✅ Fetch job order details
2. ✅ Show product handling dialog
3. ✅ If user cancels → STOP (job order stays in current status)
4. ✅ Process the selected product action
5. ✅ If product action fails → STOP with error (job order stays in current status)
6. ✅ Only if everything succeeds → Mark job order as "Done"
7. ✅ Create expense transaction
8. ✅ Show success message

### Benefits:
- ✅ Job orders are only marked as "Done" when the entire process completes successfully
- ✅ If user cancels or if any step fails, the job order remains in its current status
- ✅ Better data integrity and user experience
- ✅ Clear error messages if anything goes wrong

### Error Handling:
- User cancellation: Job order stays in current status, no message shown
- Product action failure: Job order stays in current status, error message shown
- Database errors: Job order stays in current status, error message shown

## Files Modified:
- `lib/frontend/job_orders/job_order_list_page.dart` - Updated `_markJobOrderAsDone` method

## Testing:
Test the following scenarios:
1. ✅ Complete flow (should mark as done)
2. ✅ Cancel product handling dialog (should not mark as done)
3. ✅ Product action failure (should not mark as done, show error)
4. ✅ Database connection issues (should not mark as done, show error)
